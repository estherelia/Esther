					<p>A portrait of my grandfather Alan and great-uncle John as tables.<br>Alan was unable to go to college due to his father's injury, and worked as a union painter in San Francisco. He married my grandmother who was a Central Valley farmer, and commuted to Turlock every weekend to be with his family on the farm for a couple days. He was said to always have roasted almonds in his pockets.<br>John was an engineer and helped with the planning and construction of the Golden Gate Bridge. During the genocide, he was found hiding in a garden, and was shot at three time point blank, but the gun misfired every time. The man trying to kill him took this as a sign that God wanted him to live, and left him.<br><br>2019<br>15x18x22 inches<br>Poplar, Acrylic</p>
