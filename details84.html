					<p>Grace and Martha Elia Confidant<br>Grace and Martha, sisters, were very close. Grace was always described as someone "with poor nerves." Being the eldest, she witnessed and was most affected by the events of the genocide. Now we know she had PTSD, but at the time the recommended treatment was shock therapy.<br>Martha, her younger sister, acted as a caretaker to Grace. With watchful eyes, Martha became the family historian, and many of the stories I have collected come directly from her.<br><br>2019<br>Acrylic on poplar<br>50x20x38 inches</p>
